## Records

The classification of recordings into acceptable (Group I) and unacceptable (Group II) was recorded in the RECORDS files. This classification was already made by the editors of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge. 

## Testing/Training Data Set Folder

The testig and training datasets consist of ECG recordings from set-a. The identification numbers of the ECG recordings in the respective datasets are listed in the *names* files. 
The annotation of the signals are stored in binary format in the *annotation* files, where 0 stands for acceptable and 1 for unacceptable. The columns of this list correspond to the leads of the recordings and the lines to the individual recordings. The order of the recordings in the annotation files corresponds to the order of the corresponding *names* files.
