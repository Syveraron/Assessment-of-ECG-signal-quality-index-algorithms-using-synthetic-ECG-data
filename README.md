# Signal Quality Indices with synthetic ECG data
Comparison of exisiting open-source SQI tools by incrementally increasing noise of ECG signals using a synthetic ECG generator. 
Code for project: Assessment of ECG signal quality index algorithms using synthetic ECG data. This project is assessing the robustness of several open-source Signal Quality Index Tools. This project uses a synthetic ECG generator to generate ECG signals that increase in variation through gradual changes in a variable. These signals are then passed through 4 SQI tools that are being assessed in the current project. Figure below shows the pipeline for generating data and assessing quality (figure 1 from paper):
